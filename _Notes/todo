- [x] finish implementing energy

- [x] add siren and light at >90% damage

- [] refactor damageOnImpact so that owners are detecting other collisions instead of sending damage on impact.
- [] damageOnImpact can search for InflictDamage script on colliding object to check for extra damage other than impulse force damage
- [] projectiles can use InflictDamage script.. this can also be where different damage types are defined.

==

- Projectiles: fix colliding with ship; don't activate on pool.GET(), instead, preset position and velocity before activating
